- [ ] add metadata for repo (debate title)
- [ ] add deployment information in the footer
- [ ] add modal warning for creating new contributions (cancel button and activate different contribution form)
- [ ] i19 add mouseover hint for « and » buttons
- [ ] i18 how should we handle segments which completely consists of links?
    - idea: add a button, which deactivates all links in every segment, such that it could be toggled as ordinary text
- [ ] i17 solve issue: uberspace web errorpage 500 status
- [ ] i16 print correct date for "last deployment" in footer
- [x] i15 CSRF verification failed
- [x] i14 make signup work again
    - [x] add failing test
- [x] #i13 make arrow buttons/keys work for debates with automatically uncovered contributions
- [.] #i12 allow anchor-links to segments
    - links like http://localhost:8000/d/d03-test_debate#a15 are already possible
    - [.] add a convenient way to copy segment-link -> additional tool bar (activated by click)
        - [x] add basic toolbar on segment-click
        - [ ] #i12.2 implement segmentClickManager to handle complexity
            - What should happen when a segment is clicked? Depends on:
                - Does Segment have an answer?
                - Is clicking user logged in?
                - Has debate user_b specified?
                - Is the clicking user allowed to answer the clicked segment?
                - Is there an active textarea with some unsubmitted user input (which would require modal warning?)
                - How many times has the segment being clicked directly before that click?

        - [ ] #i12.1 desired behavior for segments which might receive an answer:
            - 1st click: copy toolbar
            - 2nd click: contribution toolbar
            - 3rd click or click another segment:
                - hide both
                - show warning for text loss
        - desired behavior for segments which already have an on-click action:
            - **show contribution form**
                - integrate toolbar consistently:
                - cancel form -> deactivate segment toolbar
            - [.] **unfold answer**
                - 1st click: unfold answer, 2nd click: toolbar, 3rd click hide both
                - if answer is already unfolded -> same as if 1st click done.
                - [x] fix bug with multiple toolbars
                    - [] test frontend

- [x] first test-deployment on the web
    - [x] adapt `deploy.py`
    - [x] deploy test-repos
        - [x] find out why d02 etc are not processed
            - they are somehow not included in package_data when installing
            - [x] use MANIFEST.in as workaround
- [x] #i11 answered segments should be highlighted noticeably.
- [x] #i7 list recent debates on landing page
    - [x] for logged in user
        - [x] make debates of user available on landing page
            - [x] (#i6): add 3 more debates to fixtures
            - [x] include dates
            - [x] make them easily available
        - [x] list those three with most recent changes
            - [s] store number of answers + change date (most recent contribution) in db
            - [x] add change_date to models.Debate + fixtures
        - [x] improve display ("3 days ago")
    - [x] for anonymous user
        - [x] list of debates with most recent activity
        - [x] #i10 omit those debates which have no committed a-contribution yet

        - [x] implement solution
        - [x] test backend for all commits
        - [x] test backend for single commit

- [.] create a concept for a scenario where multiple parties want to participate:
    - challenges:
        - we want to prevent a situation where many people effectively make the same statement
        - we want to enable parties C and D to add meaningful content, either as role a or role b
            - → should be done via inclusion requests (= ui-supported merge requests)
                - simple-version: shallow authorship-tracking in git repo
                - full-featured-version: authorship-tracking in git repo
        - we want to enable parties E and F to react to the original contribution independently of B
            - There should be some hurdle (approval from either a, b, moderator or community)
            - The main hurdle might also be: reduced visibility
        - who decides which party has the privilege of role b (for now: instance moderator via admin interface)
            - The platform probably cannot solve this; also: has not to solve this.
            - The platform provides a medium, which allows to gather arguments in a traceable and comprehensible way.
    - LLM challenges:
        - prevent that users dump llm generated content without approving it.
            - as anonymous contributions are discarded, users have an incentive to only publish good statements (from their perspective)
            - -> point that out in the user guide

    - idea: use invite-codes and save invitation chain (who invited whom), who contributed meaningful content.
    - idea: use a git-based "distributed database" (consisting of many crawled repos) for reputation tracking
        - community action would be beneficial for peer reviewing
        - (automatically) organizing peer review on controversial topics is difficult
        - higher order peer reviews are necessary (reviews of reviews etc.)
        - some reward system has to be established
        - challenge:
            - reviews should be anonymous but reward status should be transparent


- [x] own segment_elements should be hover-able but not clickable ("you cannot answer to your own segment")

- [x] overhaul process of new debate creation
    - [x] (#i5) testuser_2 cannot answer to newly created contribution (js problem?)
        - reason: role b has not been assigned to any user yet
        - [x] implement pragmatic approach any user (but original author) can assume role b
            - more sophisticated approach could be taken later (invite code, moderator approval, ...)
            - [x] user_a should still not be able to open answer form
        - [x] create failing test

            - [x] create repo with some content
            - [x] create repo with correct content
                - Problem: a.md contains pure md source (without keys)

                - [x] fix fdmd
            - [x] backend test

            - [x] backend test
            - [x] frontend test (test_g120)
                - discovered bug: answerShortKey "root_segment" is not recognized
                - confusion when should I use "root_segment" and when "debate_container"?
                - current structure:
                - debate_container
                    - root_segment
                    - p_level0
                        - segment_span a1
                        - segment_span a2
                        - answer_div a2b
                            - segment_span a2b1
                            - answer_div a2b1a
                                - ...
                            - segment_span a2b2
                - [x] Solution:
                    - rename *debate_container* to **contribution_a**
                    - rename *answer_a2b* to **contribution_a2b**

                - [x] "is not yet published" field is not displayed
                    - currently created by JS-function `getSeparatorDiv`
                    - problems:
                        - segment_span (does not exist for level0)
                            - used for call insertAnswerForm(segment_span, answerKey, true);
                            - [x] add div element with id="root_segment"
                        - answer_div: unclear which div this should be: debate_wrapper? -> should work for now.
                        - [x] adapt js such that `getSeparatorDiv(segment_span, answerDiv)` is applied

        - improve logic:
            - [x] take parents and children into account (they could be already shown for different reasons)
                - desired behavior: level 3 child manually shown or automatically due to dtb_status
                  => stays visible for "→" button, but
                  disappears if `currentLevel` decreases below 3 (also if it decreases from 2->1 or 1->0)
                  => already implemented
